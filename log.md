**Date:** 01/01/2025

I signed up for [CS50x 2025](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) and watched the lecture from [week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/0/). I also started the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) certification by working through problems in the [Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/) course.

## R1D02

**Date:** 02/01/2025

Completed the [Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/) course and started working through the challenges from the [Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-basic-css-by-building-a-cafe-menu) course. These challenges are fairly quick to do as it's things I'm already comfortable with, nonetheless it never hurts to revist the fundamentals.

I began working on my [Scratch project](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1115991329) for [problem set 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/psets/0/) from [week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/0/) of [CS50x 2025](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/). My idea is a game where you have to fly a rocket from one planet to another, avoiding obstacles along the way.

## R1D05

**Date:** 05/01/2025

Spent some more time working on my Scratch project for problem set 0 from week 0 of CS50x 2025. Ended up refactoring some of the logic as I added some features.

I also finished the [Learn HTML Forms by Building a Registration Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-forms-by-building-a-registration-form) course.

I installed Neovim and started to learn how to use Vim to edit files. It's definitely confusing at first but I'm enjoying the process of learning it so far. I also worked through some of the [Learn Accessibility by Building a Quiz](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-accessibility-by-building-a-quiz/) course on freeCodeCamp.

I practiced C for CS50x and continued to work through setting up and using Vim. I update my dotfiles repo to allow me to be able to use the same vim setup across machines easily.

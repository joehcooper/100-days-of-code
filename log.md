I signed up for [CS50x 2025](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/) and watched the video from [week 0](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/weeks/0/). I also started the [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) certification by working through problems in the [Learn HTML by Building a Cat Photo App](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-html-by-building-a-cat-photo-app/) course.
